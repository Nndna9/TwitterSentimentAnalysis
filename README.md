# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Twitter sentiment analysis involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models to discern whether a tweet conveys negative, positive, or neutral emotions. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, entails identifying and categorizing sentiments expressed in text sources. The abundance of tweets serves as valuable data for comprehending public opinions on diverse topics through social media analysis. Let's look at some of the projects here:

## [Pfizer Vaccine Tweets](https://github.com/Nndna9/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/blob/main/PfizerVaccineTweets.ipynb)

I've used this dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/pfizer-vaccine-tweets
This project focuses on tweets about the Pfizer & BioNTech vaccine, which are classified into Negative, Positive and Neutral Emotions.
Then I've used 4 Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Hyper Tuning, Hyper Parameter Tuning. Which gave me the accuracies as the follow 

|  Logistic Regression | Support Vector Classifier | Hyper Tuning | Hyper Parameter Tuning |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
|      84.64%          |           87.58%          |    87.34%    |         87.58%         |


## [Twitter API](https://github.com/Nndna9/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/blob/main/TwitterAPI.ipynb)

You can also use Twitter's API to get live tweet Analysis


## [TextBlob](https://github.com/Nndna9/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/blob/main/textblob.py)

We uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis.
